a stupidly simple web browser i wrote in python, functionality for tabs and bookmarks are being worked on

you can do whatever you want with it i dont really care

requires python (obviously)

also requires a few packages like PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine

if you dont know how to download packages just go into your commands prompt and type this

pip install (insert package name here)
